# Lightweight Road Image Segmentation Algorithm Based on Multi-scale Feature Fusion

## Introduction

This paper proposed an efficient road image segmentation algorithm based on multi-scale features. Unlike the existing methods, the introduced model contains two feature extraction branches, namely the Detail Branch and the Semantic Branch. The Detail Branch extracts low-level detail information from the image, while the Semantic Branch extracts high-level semantic information. Then, these extracted multi-scale features from each branch are also fused, which can further improve the model's performance. In addition, we designed a simple and efficient feature fusion module to enhance the model's ability to encode contextual information by fusing multi-scale features. We collected and labeled a large amount of road segmentation data suitable for blind-guiding scenarios and made a corresponding data set. We conduct extensive experiments on the proposed dataset. The experimental results show that the mIoU of the proposed method is 96.5%, which is better than the existing complex models. The structure of our proposed method is shown as follow.

## Environment

- The code is developed using python 3.10 on Ubuntu 20.04.
- The proposed method should be trained and validated in GPU.
- If you want to train the proposed segmentation method on custom dataset, Nvidia GPUs are needed. 
- This code is development and tested using one Nvidia A100 GPU with 80GB memory.
